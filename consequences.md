consequences when adding fields using ckanext-scheming
======================================================

TODO:

What are the consequences when you add fields to group, organization and dataset ?
* Related to new CKAN versions 
  Are your fields still there when you upgrade?
* Harvesting from other CKAN servers
  When other CKAN servers harvest - do they get the added fields as well?
